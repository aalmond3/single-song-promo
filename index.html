  <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
  <p>It's fine, it's cool</p>
  <p>You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth</p>
  <p>And guess I'm the fool</p>
  <p>With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof</p>
  <p>I don't wanna call it off</p>
  <p>But you don't wanna call it love
  </p>
  <p>You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"</p>
  
  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
  <p>You can kiss a hundred boys in bars</p>
  <p>Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling</p>
  <p>You can say it's just the way you are</p>
  <p>Make a new excuse, another stupid reason</p>
  <p>Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)</p>
  <p>You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>
  <p>Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)</p>
  <p>You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>

  <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
  <p>I'm clich√©, who cares?</p>
  <p>It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair</p>
  <p>And I cry, it's not fair</p>
  <p>I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air</p>
  <p>Think I'm gonna call it off</p>
  <p>Even if you call it love</p>
  <p>I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"</p>
  
  <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
    <p>You can kiss a hundred boys in bars</p>
  <p>Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling</p>
  <p>You can say it's just the way you are</p>
  <p>Make a new excuse, another stupid reason</p>
  <p>Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)</p>
  <p>You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>
  <p>Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)</p>
  <p>You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>
  
  <h3>[Post-Chorus]</h3>
  <p>When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night</p>
  <p>With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife</p>
  <p>And when you think about me, all of those years ago</p>
  <p>You're standing face to face with "I told you so"</p>
  <p>You know I hate to say, "I told you so"</p>
  <p>You know I hate to say, but, I told you so</p>
